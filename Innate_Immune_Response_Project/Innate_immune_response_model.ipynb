      "# Innate Immune Response Model\n",
      "\n",
      "## Goal\n",
      "A model of innate immune response is built to investigate possible interferences to alleviate the damage, which could be potential drug targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Justification\n",
      "The innate immune response is based on the behavior of cells and related inflammatory factors. To be specific, epithelial cells and immune cells interact with each other directly, meanwhile releasing certain chemical inflammatory factors that have distinct effects on different cells. All these together form a complicated system. By creating ABM to outline the behavior of cells and related inflammatory factors, it is possible to investigate the outcome of an interference of the system. It may give out some hints on how to ameliorate the damage caused by innate immune response. It would be very hard for other methods to model this heterogeneous and non-linear system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Outline\n",
      "* Cells are implemented as mobile or stationary agents according to their type\n",
      "* Concentrations of inflammatory factors are regarded as environment parameters\n",
      "* Cell interactions, inflammatory factors generation, diffusion and elimination are implemented in model method\n",
      "* Oxy deficits and injured number of epithelial cells are used to assess the outcome of the model\n",
      "* Possible interferences including 'inflammatory factors antibody' and 'receptor modulators', are achieved by modifying parameters for medel method\n",
      "* Combinations of interventions can be used\n",
      "* Multiple runs are conducted to get the results of a certain intervention\n",
      "\n",
      "    Detailed description can be found as follows:\n",
      "    \n",
      "### I.Space\n",
      "Two-dimensional sequare grid would be utiliaze to generate the space for this model. Two layers of grids of the same size would be generated. One layer is occupied by stationary epithelial cells (EC) and the other immune cells including PMN, Mono, TH cells etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "### II.Agents\n",
      "\n",
      "#### A. EC\n",
      "* nonmobile agents fixed to one layer grid.\n",
      "* oxy: a label to represent the health status of epithelial cells, deceasing with regard to the some inflammatory factors and infection status.\n",
      "* EC_roll & EC_stick: factors governing interaction with white blood cells(PMNs and Monos).\n",
      "* is_activated: activated EC would increase the value of ec-roll and ec-stick, and produce nodulators including PAF and IL-8\n",
      "* is_injured: When oxy <20, EC is considered injured.\n",
      "* is_dead: When oxy <=0, EC is considered dead and would not react to external stimulations.\n",
      "#### B. PMN\n",
      "* mobile cells moving within two grid spaces per step in normal status\n",
      "* can sense inflammatory factors and move towards them\n",
      "* PMN_roll: when moving activated EC with EC-roll >= 3, move slowly\n",
      "* PMN_stick: PMN would stick to the EC and fix it\n",
      "* PMN_burst: After a PMN is stick, it would release cytotox\n",
      "#### C. Mono\n",
      "* mobile cells moving within two grid spaces per step in normal status\n",
      "* Mono_roll & Mono_stick: similar to PMN, but not necessarily fix EC\n",
      "* is_activated: kinds of inflammatory factors produced by PMN and the probability to heal EC would change with activation state.\n",
      "#### D. TH cells\n",
      "* TH0 cells can differenciate into TH1 and TH2 cells\n",
      "* is_activated: TH1 and TH2 cells just wander around before activation; they produce different inflammatory factors after activation\n",
      "#### E. Institution\n",
      "* 'infection' is regarded as the cause of immune response. It can increase by itself with time and propagate the infection to infection to neighbors.\n",
      "* 'antibiotics' is added to the system after total system damage have reached certain level to directly ameliorate on the 'infection' state.\n",
      "* Interventions are added to the system no earlier than the addition of antibiotics by changing the rule for updating inflammatory factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### III.Initial Conditions\n",
      "#### A. Cells\n",
      "ECs are sequentially put to one layer of the grids to fully occupy them. Other cells are randomly distributed throughout the other layer of the grid. When a place is drawn where there is already a cell occupies it, keep drawing untill an empty grid is found.\n",
      "#### B. Infection\n",
      "Some random grids are chosen and their corresponding infection value is set to 100.\n",
      "#### C. Inflammatory factors\n",
      "Concentrations of inflammatory factors are initialized as all 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "### IV.Model Parameters\n"

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "Behavior of cells and molecules related to innate immune response is simulated by modeling cells as agents that can move, occupy space and have different response to environmental factors (inflammatory factors). Molecules are modeled as environmental parameters that are updated every step with regarding to specific cells that are supposed to generate or eliminate them. The oxidative stress of epithelial cells is regarded as the entire system damage, and the system is considered collapsed if total damage exceeds certain criteria. \u2018antibiotic\u2019 is a regular treatment and it is implemented by deceasing infection directly. This treatment would serve as control. Imaginary treatment including 'inflammatory factors antibody' or 'receptor modulators' serves as additional interference of the model and may directly affect the concentration of molecules (inflammatory factors antibody) or the extent to which cells detect the molecules (receptor modulators). Different interferences/treatments are performed to observe the change to the outcome (oxy status of epithelial cells) or the time till which the system is regarded as collapse."

      "### Parameter Sweeping\n",
      "Antibodies for inflammatory factors would be modeled as directly diminishing the corresponding inflammatory factor by a certain percentage. Receptor modulators give the cell wrong information about environmental concentrations, thus the modified behavior of the cell can alter the outcome of the system.\n",

      "Total oxy deficits and injured number of epithelial cells are used to assess the outcome of the model.\n",
      "#### The initial plan is:\n",
      "* investigate what is the outcome of the simulation by setting the potency of antibody to 0.5 of one inflammatory factor at a time (antibody = 0.5 means after every certain steps, concentration of inflammatory factor is cut half)\n",

      "This model is expected to give different simulation results with sweeping parameters. It is hoped that certain interference can lower system damage at the end of the simulation compared to control group with no interference. The total system damage would be plotted against the potency of the interference to show the effect on the outcome of system.\n",

      "From the perspective of existent knowledge, the blockade of some inflammatory factors that are responsible to promote the immune response and propagate the damage is expected to achieve the ultimate goal to ameliorate the whole system. But it is still unknown for now whether the blockade of a single factor is sufficient to accomplish the task or more factors are needed to be interfered at the same time."
